# Program Synthesis: Synthesizing Operators for Integer Manipulation

## Abstract:
We describe a language to synthesize a linear sequence of arithmetic operations for integer manipulation. Given an input-output example, our language synthesizes a set of operators to be applied to the input integers to obtain the given output. The sequence is generated by using Microsoft Prose, a program synthesis framework and the Genetic Algorithm. Our approach generates a set of ranked solutions that can be made unique on additional input-output examples that are consistent.
